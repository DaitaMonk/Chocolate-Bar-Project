#### 1.2.1 Business Problem

In my chocolate-fueled adventure, I embarked on a quest to discover the best chocolate bar in town. Online ratings led me down a rabbit hole, filled with tantalizing questions:

1. What flavor profiles make chocolate bars soar in customer ratings?
2. How does cocoa percentage affect consumer preferences?
3. Does the country of origin influence chocolate bar perceptions?

Armed with curiosity, I ventured forth, ready to uncover these delicious mysteries. The quest for chocolate enlightenment had begun!

These questions provide a starting point for investigating consumer preferences and the factors that influence ratings and choices in the chocolate bar dataset. The specific research questions can be refined based on the objectives of the study and the available data.

#### 1.2.2 Performance Measure

I have chosen correlation coefficient as a performance so we can assess the linear relationship between variables, with values ranging from -1 to 1. A correlation value close to 1 indicates a strong positive correlation, while a value close to -1 indicates a strong negative correlation. A value close to 0 suggests a weak or no correlation between the variables. This performance measure is valuable in various fields, including finance, economics, psychology, and research, to analyze the connections between different factors and make informed decisions based on the observed relationships. 
Success here will mean that I succeeded in locating the most important variable that leads to high chocolate bar rating.

### 1.3 Data Understanding

This database contains over 2,500 chocolate bar ratings from around the globe!

Its focused on plain dark chocolate with an aim of appreciating the flavors of the cacao when made into chocolate. The ratings do not reflect health benefits, social missions, or organic status.

Each chocolate is evaluated from a combination of both objective qualities and subjective interpretation. A rating here only represents an experience with one bar from one batch. Batch numbers, vintages and review dates are included in the database when known.

#### Flavors of Cacao Rating System:

Flavors of Cacao Rating System:
5 = Elite (Transcending beyond the ordinary limits)
4 = Premium (Superior flavor development, character and style)
3 = Satisfactory(3.0) to praiseworthy(3.75) (well made with special qualities)
2 = Disappointing (Passable but contains at least one significant flaw)
1 = Unpleasant (mostly unpalatable)
